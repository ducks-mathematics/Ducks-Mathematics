  Imagine you are standing at a crossroads. You have not chosen left or right yet. In that moment you are not only left or only right. You are in between. This simple feeling helps us understand superposition.
  </p>

  <p>
  In physics superposition means being in more than one state at the same time. This idea comes from quantum physics which studies very small things like atoms and electrons.
  </p>

  <p>
  Think about a coin spinning in the air. It is not clearly head or tail until it lands. Until then both outcomes are possible. Quantum particles behave in a similar way by keeping many possibilities together.
  </p>

  <p>
  An electron can be here and there at the same time. A particle can behave like a wave and a particle together. Nature does not decide immediately. It waits.
  </p>

  <p>
  When we observe or measure the system the superposition ends. One clear result appears. Observation plays an important role in the quantum world.
  </p>

  <p>
  Superposition is not just a strange idea. Many modern technologies depend on it. Lasers MRI machines and quantum computers work because nature allows multiple possibilities to exist together.
  </p>

  <p>
  Superposition teaches us something beautiful. Nature keeps options open. Just like humans we often carry many possibilities inside us before making a choice.
