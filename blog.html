    <h1>What Is Quantum Mechanics</h1>
    <p><strong>The Most Mind-Bending Science of All Time</strong></p>

    <p>
      Let’s be honest, the term Quantum Mechanics sounds like something only genius scientists locked in labs would talk about.
      But here’s a secret: it’s actually the story of how the entire universe works at its deepest level.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s not just physics. It’s about reality itself, how everything around you behaves when you zoom in far enough
      that atoms look huge.
    </p>

    <h2>The World Beneath the World</h2>
    <p>
      Everything you can see—your hands, your phone, the air, even the sunlight—is made up of unimaginably tiny particles.
      But when scientists started studying how these particles behave, they found something shocking.
    </p>
    <p>They don’t follow the normal rules.</p>

    <h2>The Birth of Quantum Physics</h2>
    <p>
      In the early 1900s, brilliant minds like Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg,
      and Erwin Schrödinger discovered that the universe has another side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Light behaved like both waves and particles. Electrons jumped between energy levels instead of gliding smoothly.
    </p>

    <h2>The Strange Rules of the Quantum World</h2>

    <h3>1. Wave or Particle — Both</h3>
    <p>
      Light spreads like a wave but also hits like a tiny particle. Electrons do the same.
      They change behavior depending on how we observe them.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Superposition — Being Two Things at Once</h3>
    <p>
      In the quantum world, particles exist in multiple states at the same time.
      Only when measured do they choose one reality.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Entanglement — The Quantum Connection</h3>
    <p>
      Two particles can become linked across any distance.
      Change one, and the other responds instantly—what Einstein called “spooky action at a distance.”
    </p>

    <h2>Why Quantum Mechanics Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Every modern technology—microchips, lasers, MRI machines, and future quantum computers—
      exists because of quantum mechanics.
    </p>

    <h2>The Magic Beneath Reality</h2>
    <p>
      Even Einstein doubted quantum mechanics, saying “God does not play dice.”
      But experiments proved the universe plays beautifully.
    </p>

    <p><strong>
      Quantum mechanics shows us that reality is not rigid.
      It’s mysterious, powerful, and endlessly fascinating.
